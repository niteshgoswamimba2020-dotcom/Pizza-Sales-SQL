# 🍕 Pizza Sales Analysis using MySQL

## 📌 Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing a pizza restaurant’s sales data using **MySQL** to extract meaningful business insights.  
The analysis helps understand sales performance, customer preferences, and revenue trends by querying a relational database.

This project was created as part of my **Data Analyst learning journey** to strengthen SQL skills through a real-world dataset.

## 🗂 Database Schema
The database consists of the following four tables:

- **orders** – Order ID, order date, and order time  
- **order_details** – Order ID, pizza ID, and quantity  
- **pizzas** – Pizza ID, size, and price  
- **pizza_types** – Pizza name and category (Classic, Veggie, etc.)

## 🎯 Objectives
The main goals of this project were to:

- Analyze total orders and total revenue
- Identify best-selling pizzas and categories
- Understand customer ordering patterns
- Perform revenue and time-based analysis
- Practice advanced SQL concepts
